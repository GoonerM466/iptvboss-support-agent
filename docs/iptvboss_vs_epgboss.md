# IPTVBoss Vs. EPGBoss - Whats the difference?

### IPTVBoss

An IPTV editor (you use on a computer) that has ALL of our EPGs built-in meant for the end-user.
It gives the user the ability to customize your IPTV playlist, map the channels you want to our EPG, and the output links go into Tivimate or iMPlayer etc.
Pro comes with many additional features, with AED (Advanced EPG Dummy) being one many users love the most - giving you proper EPG listings for all your sprts event channels such as team channels, PPV, etc.

### EPGBoss

EPG only service technically meant for using on a panel, other software, or similar.  

This requires the data to be mapped to your channels in the panel etc.

If you are an end-user, you will take either the XML or GZ link and paste it into you favorite IPTV playlist editor or IPTV player app (i.e. Tivimate or iMPlayer).
If you want to use the link in an IPTV player app, you will have to map channels on that player app as more than likely the IPTV source's EPG-ID's dont match 100% with our XMLTV-IDs. This can be extreamy time consuming.

Be aware these are IP locked meaning only 1  IP address can be used to access them.

Each country EPG costs $4/monthly, except for the International Sports EPG which is $10/monthly.
*Longer subscription lengths are available*

### Recommendations
For an end user, its usually more recommended to subscribe to the IPTVBoss editor.
It has **all** our EPGs built-in and is much easier/faster to map your channels - getting you perfect EPG in no time at all!
Once you've set up, you put the custom output M3U and XML links in whatever IPTV player you want, set up the sync schedule, and Boss will keep everything updated and looking beautiful... and it considerably cheaper at just $25/year!

EPGBoss is definitely an option for anyone as i mentioned above, but for personal & family-style use IPTVBoss is king!
