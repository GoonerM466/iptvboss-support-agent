# Reporting Issues - Guidelines

How to effectively report new issues and contribute workarounds.

### When Reporting New Issues

**Before posting:**

1. **Check** FAQ and Troubleshooting Guide first
2. **Search** Discord support channel (likely already discussed)

**What to include:**

3. **Include**:
   - Boss version
   - Operating system
   - Logs from IPTVBoss/logs (clean sensitive info!)
   - Clear description of problem
   - Steps to reproduce
   - What you've already tried
4. **Post** in Discord support channel (not DM - community can help)

**Don't include in logs:**
- Provider names or URLs
- Usernames or passwords
- Personal information
- License keys

### Contributing Workarounds

Found a workaround for a known issue? Help the community:

1. Post in Discord with clear steps
2. Tag moderators to add to documentation
3. Be specific - others need to reproduce your success

### Issue Priorities

**Critical**: Blocks major functionality, data loss risk
**High**: Significant usability impact, affects core features
**Medium**: Annoying but workable, workarounds exist
**Low**: Cosmetic or minor inconvenience
