# Deleted Channels Not Removed in TiviMate

You need to complete all three steps for changes to appear.

### Problem

Channels or groups deleted in IPTVBoss are not showing as removed in TiviMate or other players.

### Solution

Complete all three steps:

1. **In IPTVBoss**: Delete channels/groups using the (-) button and save
2. **Output**: Go to **Layout Manager ’ Output Current Layout M3U and EPG**
3. **In TiviMate**: Update your playlist (Settings ’ Playlists ’ Select playlist ’ Update)

Deleting in IPTVBoss alone won't affect your player until you output the new files and update the playlist in your player app.
