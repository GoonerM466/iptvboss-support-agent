# Changes Not Showing Up in Player

IPTVBoss doesn't automatically push changes to your player.

### Problem

Changes made in IPTVBoss (layouts, EPG mappings, channel edits, etc.) aren't showing up in your player app.

### Solution

**Required workflow:**

1. Make your changes in IPTVBoss (layouts, EPG mappings, channel edits, etc.)
2. **Output** your layout: **Layout Manager ’ Output Current Layout's M3U and EPG**
3. Wait for files to upload to your cloud storage
4. **Update** the playlist in your player app (TiviMate: Settings ’ Playlists ’ Update)

### Important Notes

If using TinyURL, verify your TinyURL links have updated before updating the player.
