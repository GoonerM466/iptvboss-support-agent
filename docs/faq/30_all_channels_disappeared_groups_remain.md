# All Channels Disappeared from Layout After Sync But Groups Remain

Provider changed channel structure/IDs - restore immediately.

### Problem

All your channels disappeared from layout after syncing, but groups remain.

### Solution

**Restore immediately:**

1. **Menu ’ Restore ’ Local, Cloud or URL**
2. Select backup from before the sync
3. This recovers your channel mappings

### Why This Happened

- Provider changed channel structure/IDs
- Boss saw all channels as "removed"
- Your group structure remained but channel assignments were lost

### Prevention

Keep regular backups before syncing. Use XC sources when possible (more stable).
