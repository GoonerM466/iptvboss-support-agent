# New Machine Setup - Restore Keeps Removing Token

Setup order matters - enter license first before restoring.

### Problem

Setting up IPTVBoss on new machine - restore keeps removing Boss token and failing.

### Solution

**Setup order matters:**

1. Install IPTVBoss on new machine
2. Enter Pro license key FIRST
3. Set up cloud credentials (Google Drive/Dropbox)
4. THEN restore from cloud

**Check:**

- Using new IPTVBoss website credentials (not old site)
- License is still active
- Internet connection works
- Logs for specific error messages

Logs help diagnose - post in support Discord with cleaned logs (remove provider names and sensitive info).
