# Provider Shows All Categories Despite Filtering

Your player is loading the provider's original M3U file instead of IPTVBoss's filtered output.

### Problem

Your IPTV provider shows ALL categories in your player despite filtering in IPTVBoss.

### Solution

**Check:**

1. Verify in your player that you're using the **IPTVBoss M3U URL** (from Dropbox/Google Drive/TinyURL), NOT your provider's direct URL
2. Confirm you've output the layout from IPTVBoss after making changes
3. Update the playlist in your player after outputting

**If still showing all categories:**

Remove the playlist completely from your player and re-add it using only the IPTVBoss URL. This ensures no cached provider data remains.
