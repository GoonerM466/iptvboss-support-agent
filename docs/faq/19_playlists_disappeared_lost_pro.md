# All Playlists Disappeared and Lost Pro License

Your backups should still exist - restore database and re-enter license.

### Problem

All your playlists disappeared and you lost your Pro license.

### Solution

**Don't panic - your backups should still exist.**

**Recovery steps:**

1. Re-enter your Pro license key (**Menu ’ Activate Pro**)
2. Restore database: **Menu ’ Restore ’ Local or Cloud**
3. Select the most recent backup that predates the problem
4. If you've migrated to the new IPTVBoss website, make sure you're using new credentials

**If restore doesn't work:**

- Try multiple backup files (the newest might be corrupted too)
- Check that `IPTVBoss/backup` folder exists and contains .backup files
- Verify disk isn't full
- Check logs for specific error messages
