# Show Live Sports with NEW Tag Instead of LIVE

Some DVR software only records episodes marked "NEW", not "LIVE".

### Question

How do I show live sports with "NEW" tag instead of "LIVE" for DVR recording?

### Answer

Some DVR software (Emby, Plex, etc.) only records episodes marked "NEW", not "LIVE".

**Solution:**

1. Go to **Settings ’ Manage Live Tags**
2. Change "Live Tag Format" to "New"
3. Output your playlist and EPG
4. Update in your player/DVR

This tags live sports events as "NEW" so your DVR will record them.
