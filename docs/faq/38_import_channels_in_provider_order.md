# Import Channels in Provider's Original Order

Disable A-Z sorting when importing to preserve provider's channel order.

### Question

How do I import channels in the same order my provider has them, instead of alphabetically?

### Answer

**When importing channels, untick the "A-Z" checkbox:**

1. Open Layout Editor for your layout
2. Click **Add Channels** button
3. In the Import dialog:
   - Select your source
   - Select the category/group you want to import
   - **Untick the "A-Z" checkbox** (bottom of dialog)
4. Click **Import Source**

**Result**: Channels will be imported in the exact order your provider has them.

### Important Notes

**A-Z checkbox controls sorting**:
- **Ticked** (default): Channels imported alphabetically (A-Z)
- **Unticked**: Channels imported in provider's original order

**After importing**:
- You can still manually reorder channels by dragging them
- You can still sort groups using Layout Editor features

**For bulk imports**:
- If importing multiple categories, untick A-Z for each import
- Provider order is preserved per-category

### Use Cases

**When to use provider order**:
- Your provider has channels logically organized;
   - Sports channels grouped by league
   - Uses channels as separators
- Provider has premium/HD channels grouped together

**When to use A-Z order**:
- You want channels alphabetically sorted
- Easier to find specific channels
- Creating custom layouts from scratch
