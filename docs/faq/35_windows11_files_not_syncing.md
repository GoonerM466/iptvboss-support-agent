# Windows 11 Upgrade - Files Not Syncing to Devices

Check folder permissions and firewall rules after OS upgrade.

### Problem

After OS upgrade to Windows 11, files aren't syncing to devices.

### Solution

**Check:**

- IPTVBoss folder permissions after OS upgrade
- Firewall rules might have reset

If you copied the IPTVBoss folder from Windows 10, it should work, but cloud reauthorization is often needed after OS changes.
