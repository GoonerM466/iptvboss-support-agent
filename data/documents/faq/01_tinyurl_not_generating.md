# TinyURL Links Not Generating on Output

Your TinyURL API key is missing or incorrect.

### Problem

When you output your playlist, TinyURL links are not being generated.

### Solution

1. **Create a TinyURL account** at tinyurl.com (if you haven't already)
2. **Generate an API key** with all permissions enabled
3. In IPTVBoss: Go to **Settings → TinyURL** and enter your API key
4. Delete the existing cloud file from your Dropbox/Google Drive website
5. Output your playlist and EPG again

### Important Notes

**This will generate new cloud links for any file you deleted whicc *must* be updated on any player it was used on**

IPTVBoss now requires the new TinyURL API system (announced in Discord). Old TinyURL credentials won't work.
