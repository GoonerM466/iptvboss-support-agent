# Prompted to Upgrade to Pro Despite Valid License

Verify license is active and migrate to new website if needed.

### Problem

You're prompted to upgrade to Pro despite having a valid license.

### Solution

**Check:**

1. Verify your license is still active (check purchase date/subscription)
2. Migrate to the new IPTVBoss website if using the old system
3. Use the license key from the NEW website, not old credentials
4. Ensure internet connection is active (validates online)

**If still failing:**

- Check if Boss Pro website is accessible
- Wait several minutes after entering the key
- Contact support if license shows active but won't validate
