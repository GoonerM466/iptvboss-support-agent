# Multiple Layouts Only Show Guide for First Layout

Use Universal EPG instead of individual EPGs per layout.

### Problem

You created additional layouts/EPGs but they only show guide for the first layout, then "No Information" for the others.

### Solution

**Use Universal EPG instead:**

1. Set up Universal EPG once: **Sources ’ Universal EPG Options**
2. All layouts automatically use the same EPG source
3. No need to manage multiple EPG files
4. Saves significant cloud bandwidth

**If you must use individual EPGs:**

- Check "Days to Keep" settings for the layout (not just source)
- Verify EPG source is syncing properly (check last sync time)
- Look for override settings affecting EPG duration
- You may need to delete cached EPG files and re-sync

**Recommendation**: Universal EPG is the recommended approach for multiple layouts.
