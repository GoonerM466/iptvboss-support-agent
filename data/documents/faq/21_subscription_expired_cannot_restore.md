# Subscription Expired and Cannot Restore Database

Enter new license key before restoring from old database.

### Problem

Your subscription expired and now you can't restore your database.

### Solution

**If you renewed with a new key:**

1. Don't try restoring old database first
2. Install IPTVBoss fresh
3. Enter NEW license key
4. After Pro is activated, then restore from backup
   - Ensure token is NEW one after restoring

**If using old database backup with new key:**

- Some users report database backups tied to old license keys
- Try system restore to before expiration, open Boss, enter new key while old DB is loaded
- Or restore from external drive backup if you have one

**Lesson**: Keep external backups before license expiration, and update your license before it expires to avoid this issue.
