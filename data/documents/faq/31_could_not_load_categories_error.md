# Could Not Load Categories - Check Your Source Link

Source validation failed - verify URL, credentials, and provider service.

### Problem

You're getting "Could not load categories, check your source link" error.

### Solution

**Source validation steps:**

1. Verify M3U URL is accessible (paste in browser, should download)
2. Check username/password are correct
3. Ensure provider service is active
4. Try source URL in VLC to verify it's valid M3U format

**Common causes:**

- Expired service/credentials
- Provider URL changed
- M3U format is malformed
- Network/firewall blocking access

**Recommendation**: Try XC API instead of M3U URL if your provider offers it - more reliable.
