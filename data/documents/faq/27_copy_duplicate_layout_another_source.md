# Copy or Duplicate Layout for Another Source or User

Use the User System for identical layouts across sources.

### Question

Can I copy/duplicate a layout to use for another source or user?

### Answer
**Not another source - it **must** resolve to the same provider**

**For identical layouts across sources**: Use the User System
- This is designed for creating the same layout for multiple users with the same source/provider 
- See documentation for User System setup

**For similar but customizable layouts**:
- Use the user system & import groups from the primary layout
- You'll need to manually manage these groups and channels
- You can also import groups from other layouts as "linked" groups, which will be synced with the layout they were imported from

**If both sources are from the same server**: User System is definitely what you want.

**If the provider or source is different there are no short cuts unfortunetely**: each source is required to be setup / mapped once.
