# EPG Layout Title Doesn't Show Teams for Sports

Sports events show generic title instead of team matchup.

### Status

EPG source data limitation.

### Problem

College football and sports games show generic titles rather than specific team matchups in EPG title field.

### Symptoms

- College football games show "NCAA Football" in title
- Team matchup only in description, not title
- Affects DVR recording rules

### Root Cause

EPG source provides data this way.

### Workaround

Use EPG title format settings (may have limited control).

### Recommended

Use AED instead to populate EPG for sports & event channels.
