# Feature Request: Prevent Source Sync Temporarily

Request for easy way to temporarily pause source synchronization.

### Current Limitation

Can disable source, but cumbersome.

### Feature Request

"Pause sync for this source" toggle.

### Use Case

Provider unstable, don't want auto-sync breaking layouts. Need temporary pause without full source disable.
