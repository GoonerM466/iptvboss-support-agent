# Using TinyURL for Short Links

### Using TinyURL for Short Links

TinyURL converts long cloud storage URLs into short, manageable links.

**Why use it**:
- Cloud URLs are extremely long (100+ characters)
- Hard to type or share
- TinyURL creates short URLs (20-30 characters)

**Setup**:

1. **Create TinyURL account** (tinyurl.com)
2. **Generate API key** (in TinyURL account settings)
3. **Configure in Boss** (Settings → TinyURL)
4. **Enter API key**, save

**Usage**:
- After output, TinyURL links automatically generated
- View Cloud Links shows both full URLs and TinyURL versions
- Use TinyURL versions in players for convenience

**Troubleshooting**:
- "Unauthenticated": API key not entered or wrong
- "503": TinyURL service down (temporary)
- Links not generating: Delete cloud files, re-output

**Alternative**: You can skip TinyURL and use direct cloud URLs. They work fine, just longer.
