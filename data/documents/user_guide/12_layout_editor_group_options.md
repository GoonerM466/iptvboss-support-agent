# Layout Editor - Group Options

When you select a group, the Group Options panel lets you configure group settings.

**Group Name**:
- Editable text box
- Your custom name for this group
- Appears in player apps

**Use Channel Name EPG Dummy for Unassigned Channels**:
- When enabled: Channels without EPG get a "Channel Name EPG Dummy"
- This creates placeholder EPG using channel name
- Useful for channels that don't have real EPG available
- **Note**: This is for regular EPG sources, not AED (Advanced EPG Dummies)
- For AED/sports events, see Advanced EPG Dummies feature

**Save Group(s)**:
- Saves changes to group settings
- Click after changing group name or options
