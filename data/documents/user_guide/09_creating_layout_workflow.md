# Creating a Layout - Workflow and Strategies

**Creating a layout**:

1. **Start new layout**
   - Layout → Layout Manager (then click "+" to create new)
   - Name it descriptively (e.g., "Family", "Sports", "John's Playlist")

2. **Add channels from source**
   - Select your layout
   - Click "Add Channels"
   - Browse your source's categories
   - Select groups or individual channels
   - Click "Add to Layout"

3. **Assing EPG**
   - Select a channel or channels
   - Select only the EPG region for the channel yo uare mapping in Search Options
   - Click Auto

4. **Organize channels**
   - Drag channels between groups
   - Rename groups for clarity
   - Delete unwanted channels (click channel, click minus/delete button)
   - Delete unwanted groups
   - Reorder channels within groups

**Layout strategies**:

**Single comprehensive layout**:
- All channels organized by type (Sports, Movies, News, etc.)
- Good for personal use
- Easier to maintain

**Multiple specialized layouts**:
- "Kids Safe" - only kid-appropriate channels
- "Sports Only" - sports channels
- "International" - specific language channels
- Good for family or multiple users with different needs

**Tips**:
- Start small - add favorites first, expand later
- Delete what you won't watch - clutter makes navigation hard
- Use consistent naming - "Sports: NFL" better than random names
- For advanced users, consider custom groups & group logically - by topic, not by provider's categories
