# Creating a Layout - Workflow and Strategies

### Creating a layout

**Start new layout**:
- Layout → Layout Manager (then click "+" to create new)
- Name it descriptively (e.g., "Family", "Sports", "John's Playlist")

**Add channels from source**:
- Select your layout
- Click "Add Channels"
- Browse your source's categories
- Select groups or individual channels
- Click "Add to Layout"

**Assign EPG**:
- Select a channel or channels
- Select only the EPG region for the channel you are mapping in Search Options
- Click Auto

**Organize channels**:
- Drag channels between groups
- Rename groups for clarity
- Delete unwanted channels (click channel, click minus/delete button)
- Delete unwanted groups
- Reorder channels within groups

### Layout strategies

**Single comprehensive layout**:
- All channels organized by type (Sports, Movies, News, etc.)
- Good for personal use
- Easier to maintain

**Multiple specialized layouts**:
- "Kids Safe" - only kid-appropriate channels
- "Sports Only" - sports channels
- "International" - specific language channels
- Good for family or multiple users with different needs

### Tips

- Start small - add favorites first, expand later
- Delete what you won't watch - clutter makes navigation hard
- Use consistent naming - "Sports: NFL" better than random names
- For advanced users, consider custom groups & group logically - by topic, not by provider's categories
