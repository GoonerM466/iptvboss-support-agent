# Layout Editor - Additional Features


**Visual Reference**: [image21](https://goonerm466.github.io/iptvboss-support-agent/images/image21.png) - Layout Editor panel showing groups list, channels list, channel options, and group options interface
**Undo/Redo**:
- Most actions in Layout Editor can be undone
- Use Undo and Redo buttons in top toolbar
- Very helpful when accidentally deleting/moving channels

**Highlight Missing EPGs** (Preferences):
- Enable in Preferences to colorize channels based on EPG status
- Shows which channels still need EPG mapping
- **Important**: Color indicates EPG is assigned, NOT that it's correct
- You still need to verify EPG mappings are accurate

**Find and Replace** (Magnifying glass icon):
- Above Channels list
- Opens dialog for batch find/replace operations
- **Note**: Only affects channels, not groups
- Use for removing prefixes, fixing naming patterns, etc.

**Prefix Auto-Removal**:
- **Sources → Prefix Auto-Removal**
- Automatically removes common prefixes from channel names
- Alternative to manual find/replace
