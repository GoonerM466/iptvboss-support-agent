# Managing Playlist Sources - Adding

#### Managing Playlist Sources

**Adding Sources**:

There are 3 ways to add playlist sources:

1. **M3U URL** (Basic):
   - Name the playlist (don't use symbols in name)
   - Paste M3U URL or browse for local file
   - **Important**: If playlist uses username/password in video links:
     - Enable "Source Uses Username/Password"
     - Enter username and password
     - Required if planning multiple users or XC conversion later

2. **XC API** (Recommended):
   - Name the playlist
   - Add IPTV service username/password
   - Add IPTV URL up to port (some providers don't have port)
   - Example: `http://myiptvservice.net:1234`

3. **Custom** (Advanced):
   - For non-standard sources
   - Custom configuration required

**After Adding - Load Categories**:
- Click "Load Categories"
- Wait for provider categories to load
- Multi-select categories you want to edit if needed (Ctrl+Click)
- Right-click to change the sync status for selected group(s)
