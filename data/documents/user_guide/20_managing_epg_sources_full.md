# Managing EPG Sources

### Managing EPG Sources

Boss Pro includes many built-in EPG sources. You enable what you need.

**Available sources**:
- US: US channels (networks, cable, etc.)
- UK: UK channels (networks, cable, etc.)
- International Sports: Comprehensive sports EPG
- Many others (By region)

**Enabling sources**:

1. **Access EPG sources**
   - Sources → Sources Manager
   - Click "Add EPG" to add EPG sources

2. **Enable needed sources**
   - Add only sources you need
   - Don't enable everything - only what you actually use
   - More sources = slower sync, more bandwidth

3. **Sync EPG**
   - Sources → Sync All EPGs
   - Downloads current EPG data
   - Takes 1-15 minutes depending on sources enabled

4. **Set sync schedule**
   - Configure via automation (Task Scheduler/cron)
   - Automatic daily syncs recommended
   - 1-2x daily is typical

**External EPG sources**:
- You can add external EPG XML files if needed
- Sources → Sources Manager → Add EPG
- Provide URL to EPG XML file
- Less common - built-in sources usually sufficient
