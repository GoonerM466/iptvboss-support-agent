# Backing Up Your Database

### Backing Up Your Database

Database contains all your layouts, mappings, and settings. Back it up regularly.

**Automatic backups**:
- Boss creates automatic backups periodically
- Stored in IPTVBoss/backup folder
- Dated files (e.g., `backup_2024-11-01.backup`)
- Keeps several recent backups

**Periodic External backup**:
1. Copy entire `IPTVBoss/backup` folder to USB drive or similar
2. Do this as needed or before major changes
3. Protects against complete system failure
