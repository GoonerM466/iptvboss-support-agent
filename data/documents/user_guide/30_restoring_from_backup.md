# Restoring from Backup

When things go wrong, restore from backup.

**When to restore**:
- Database corruption
- All layouts disappeared
- Accidental deletion
- After bad source sync
- Lost Pro license
- Moving to new computer

**Restore process**:

1. **Open IPTVBoss** (if possible)
   - May show empty if database is corrupted
   - That's okay

2. **Access restore**
   - Menu → Restore
   - Choose Local, Cloud or URL

3. **Select backup**
   - Browse backup files
   - URL must point to a direct download file

4. **Wait for restore**
   - Takes 1-5 minutes
   - Don't interrupt

5. **Verify**
   - Check layouts are back
   - Verify EPG mappings
   - Re-enter Pro license if needed

**If restore fails**:
- Try older backup
- Recent one might be corrupted too
- Try cloud or URL restore if local fails (or vice versa)

**After restore**:
- Re-enter Pro license if prompted
- Verify cloud storage authorization
- Test output to ensure everything works
